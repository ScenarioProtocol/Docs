# Scenario Protocol
Litepaper V1.0

## What is it? {{ anchor: true }}

SCENARIO is a protocol-as-a-service which supports user-requested notifications and oracle-style data outputs. It facilitates on-chain consensus about a wide range of user-defined, real-world occurrences and scenarios, resulting in data triggers which initially meet a market need (bespoke notifications) but which can also have valuable oracle-style use cases in time.

## Who uses it? {{ anchor: true }}

SCENARIO’s data-creation engine is its use as an on-chain marketplace that connects two types of user: 

1) people who are prepared to pay a small fee to be notified once highly specific events or scenarios have taken place, and; 
2) people who are economically incentivised to quickly and correctly contribute to a confirmation that these scenarios have occurred 

SCENARIO makes it possible to take a bespoke, off-chain event that is anticipated to occur in the future and represent that event on-chain in a ‘has / has not yet’ occurred format. Users of the protocol can create any scenario they wish. They can also choose to join other user-created scenarios if they want to be notified when those scenarios occur.

As the protocol matures, in addition to driving notifications, the protocol’s on-chain scenarios and data outputs also have the potential to be leveraged in DeFi protocols, prediction markets or other decentralised applications.
