# Deployment

The protocol will be deployed initially on <a href="https://portal.arbitrum.one/" target="_blank">Arbitrum</a>, an Ethereum Layer 2. This will be important for ensuring that transaction fees are low (currently in the range of $0.05 - $0.15 per tx, and expected to reduce significantly following Ethereumâ€™s implementation of <a href="https://www.eip4844.com/" target="_blank">EIP 4844</a>). 

In time, the protocol may also be deployed on further Ethereum layer 2s such as <a hef="https://www.optimism.io/" target="_blank">Optimism</a>, <a href="https://zksync.io/" target="_blank">zkSync Era</a> or <a href="https://polygon.technology/" target="_blank">Polygon</a>. The chain on which the SNR token will be initially created will be determined nearer to the TGE, with Arbitrum likely to be the preferred option.
