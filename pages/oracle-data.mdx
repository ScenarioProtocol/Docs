  'Scenario Protocol generates verifiable, onchain data about real-world events that can power smart contracts, prediction markets, and the next generation of decentralized applications.'

# Novel Oracle Data Generation

In addition to user-requested alerts, SCENARIO can provide and monetize an ancillary but extremely valuable service: oracle data.

Each scenario that is confirmed by the protocol also generates verifiable, onchain data about real-world occurrences: “X event was confirmed to have occurred at Y time; it was verified by N actors, each of which had ABC protocol reputation accrued (and at stake).”

This oracle data will greatly expand upon what is currently available through services such as UMA and Chainlink, creating a long tail of user-driven outputs that can be used to trigger smart contracts, power prediction markets, and fuel entirely new categories of decentralized applications.

## Scenario's oracle data is:

- **Demand-driven**: Only events people actually care about get tracked and generated as data
- **Crowd-verified**: Multiple independent confirmers validate each event
- **Economically secured**: Staking and slashing mechanisms underpin honest reporting
- **Broadly accessible**: Anyone can contribute to or consume the data
- **Highly granular**: From major market events to niche community milestones or releases
- **Modular and composable**

### Automated DeFi Protocols

```solidity
// Example: Auto-liquidation based on regulatory news
contract RegulationTrigger {
    function checkScenarioResolution(uint256 scenarioId) external {
        if (ScenarioOracle.isResolved(scenarioId, "SEC_ETHEREUM_RULING")) {
            // Automatically adjust protocol parameters
            adjustCollateralRatios();
            pauseHighRiskOperations();
            notifyStakeholders();
        }
    }
}
```

### SCENARIO’s oracle data will have the potential to inform and power:

- DeFi market events
- Prediction market resolutions
- Governance & DAO operations
- Risk flags and alerts in response to critical events (both onchain and offchain)
- Risk assessments and pricing model adjustments based on real-world developments
- Compliance automation based on regulatory changes in real-time

### Infinite Market Creation
Anyone can create prediction markets around any Scenario event:
- **"Will the Fed raise rates at the next meeting?"** ← Scenario tracks the announcement
- **"Will X token launch before Y date?"** ← Scenario confirms the launch
- **"Will the next Ethereum upgrade be delayed?"** ← Scenario monitors development milestones

### Unique Capabilities

**1. Niche & Long-Tail Events**
Scenario's demand-driven model means even highly specific events can get reliable oracle data:
- Small protocol launches
- Regional news events
- Community-specific milestones
- Emerging trend confirmations

**2. Temporal Flexibility**
Create scenarios for events that might happen in minutes, days, or years:
- "Breaking news in the next hour"
- "Election results by midnight"
- "Technology breakthrough by 2025"

## Future Possibilities {{ anchor: true }}

### AI-Enhanced Verification
Combine human verification with AI:
- **Pre-filtering**: AI systems flag potential events for human verification
- **Confidence Scoring**: Machine learning enhances confirmation reliability
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify related events and market implications

## Economic Opportunities {{ anchor: true }}

### For Developers
- **Oracle Fees**: Charge for high-frequency oracle data access
