# Notifications

Moving from on-chain scenario resolution to off-chain notification

<Note>
  Once the on-chain scenario pool workflow is marked as 'RESOLVED' (as shown in the final phase in [Workflow](/workflow), the notification service will be triggered. It is at this step that the on-chain process produces an output which triggers the off-chain notification service.
