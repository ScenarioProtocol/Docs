# Staged Roll-out

The protocol will be deployed using a staged approach. Features will be added gradually, with early testing to be limited to white-listed addresses taken from projects and communities that are known to be highly engaged, knowledgeable and crypto-native.

The SNR token will not be generated and distributed during the earliest testing phases, with a points system instead being used to reward and penalise early participants. This process will be called 'reputation scoring'.

## Reputation Scoring

Reputation points will act as a tool for the founding team to foster desirable user behaviour, and as a placeholder and partially-determining factor for later token distribution. Reputation scoring prior to the token’s existence will ensure that the protocol’s initial users and testers have a motivation for acting honestly and in a manner that is consistent with already having collateral at stake. 

The founding team will take an active role in monitoring and rewarding early user behaviour, explicitly engaging with this user base for two-way feedback and refinement of the protocol’s various reward and penalisation parameters.

Other potential considerations during the staged roll-out phase may include:<br/>
* restrictions on the number of scenario pools that can be created
* limitations on the total bounty size allowable for a single scenario pool
* experimentation with notification methods
* more active participation, moderation or curation of pools by the founding team
* flexible approaches to the addition or subtraction of reputation points (prior to token launch)
