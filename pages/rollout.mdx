# Staged Roll-out

The protocol will be deployed using a staged approach. Features will be added gradually, with early testing to be limited to white-listed addresses taken from projects and communities that are known to be highly engaged, knowledgeable and crypto-native.

The SNR token will not be generated and distributed during the earliest testing phases, with an off-chain scoring system instead being used to reward and/or penalise early participants. This process will be called 'reputation scoring'.

Reputation scoring will continue to be a core feature of the protocol as it matures, with the accuracy, reliability and speed of the work performed by confirmers (along with their staked collateral) contributing to a reputation ranking.

## Reputation Scoring

Tracking and measuring Confirmer performance (accuracy, honesty, timeliness) will be central to fostering desirable user behaviour. Reputation scoring prior to the token’s existence will also ensure that the protocol’s initial users and testers have a motivation for acting honestly and in a manner that is consistent with already having collateral at stake. 

The founding team will take an active role in monitoring and rewarding early user behaviour, explicitly engaging with this user base for two-way feedback and refinement of the protocol’s various reward and penalisation parameters.

Other potential considerations during the staged roll-out phase may include:<br/>
* restrictions on the number of scenario pools that can be created
* limitations on the total bounty size allowable for a single scenario pool
* experimentation with notification methods
* more active participation, moderation or curation of pools by the founding team
* flexible approaches to the methods used for measuring and assessing Confirmer performance & reputation
