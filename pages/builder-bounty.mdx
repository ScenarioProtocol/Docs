# Builder Bounty Fund & SDK

A portion of the Scenario project treasury will be set aside for targeted builder bounty programs (to be awarded at the discretion of the Scenario Labs). The primary focus of this fund will be to encourage other builders to partner with Scenario Labs and develop new and/or novel solutions for the protocol’s front-end, potentially creating new drivers for user onboarding through different user groups or niche topics.

A JavaScript software development kit (SDK) will provide a quick and easy way for third-party developers to interact with Scenario's smart contracts. The SDK will be designed to support both web2 and web3-native developers and allow them to build performant front-ends without having to worry about how best to communicate with the blockchain or have a strong understanding of the Solidity language. All functionality relating to SCENARIO contracts, such as creating, joining and confirming pools, will be abstracted away behind an easy-to-use SDK.

Initially, the builder bounty fund will also be the recipient of 50% of any slashed SNR in instances where users are penalised for dishonest pool resolutions. Once the protocol has reached maturity and the founding team’s involvement has reduced or ended, slashed SNR will instead be redirected to SNR stakers.
