# Scenario Agent

The Scenario Agent will be a way for users to gain access to Scenario's data. We'll create a suite of tools for the agent to leverage, as well as the best LLMs on the market. These tools will enable the Scenario Agent to provide intelligent, automated assistance to users of the platform.

## Core Capabilities

The Scenario Agent will be equipped with powerful tools and capabilities that enable seamless interaction with the Scenario Protocol:

### Smart Notifications {{ anchor: true }}

**Alert the user when new scenarios are added to the platform.** Users can request this in plain language by specifying their interests. The agent will understand natural language requests like:
- "Let me know when any new scenarios about DeFi protocols are created"
- "Alert me about scenarios related to Ethereum upgrades"
- "Notify me when scenarios about AI developments are posted"

### Automated Participation {{ anchor: true }}

**Auto-join new scenarios, given parameters.** Users can set up intelligent automation rules such as:
- "Join any scenario about token launches involving OpenSea"
- "Automatically participate in scenarios about regulatory updates"
- "Join scenarios related to my portfolio tokens when the fee is reasonable"

### Data Insights {{ anchor: true }}

**Build insights from platform data.** The agent will analyze and provide insights on:
- **Scenarios**: Trending topics, success rates, time to resolution
- **Alert requesters**: User behavior patterns, popular notification types
- **Confirmers**: Performance metrics, reliability scores
- **Topics**: Emerging trends, semantic similarity between scenarios
- **Market dynamics**: Fee patterns, participation rates

### Content Assistance {{ anchor: true }}

**Help create well-written and confirmable scenario descriptions.** The agent will assist users in:
- Writing clear, unambiguous scenario descriptions
- Ensuring scenarios are confirmable by the community
- Suggesting optimal parameters for scenarios
- Providing templates for common scenario types

### Situational Analysis {{ anchor: true }}

**Reason about the state of a given topic.** Given searchable information and the state of scenarios (confirmed or open), the agent can:
- Analyze current market conditions for specific topics
- Provide context about ongoing scenarios
- Identify patterns in confirmation outcomes
- Suggest optimal timing for creating new scenarios

### Interactive Chat {{ anchor: true }}

**Chat to the user about behavior on the platform, looking up data in realtime.** The agent will provide:
- Real-time platform statistics
- Personal performance analytics
- Recommendations for optimization
- Answers to questions about protocol mechanics
- Historical data analysis and trends

## Technical Implementation

The Scenario Agent will be built on top of:

### Advanced Language Models
