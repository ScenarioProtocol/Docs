  "Details on Scenario Protocol's Arbiter Fund"

# Arbiter Fund

It is important that the protocol has a sustainable method for incentivizing users to act as arbiters when pools are disputed. Whilst it would be possible to take these funds directly from pools as they are resolved through arbitration, this risks incentive misalignment, as it may encourage arbiters to ensure that a disputed pool is resolved in order to receive their arbitration fee from that pool’s funds.

The creation of an arbiter fund is therefore needed to ensure that funds exist to pay arbiters, irrespective of which way they vote when called up on arbitrate on a disputed pool.

To support this arbiter fund, 3% of all funds from resolved pools across the life of the protocol will be set aside for this purpose. Additionally, the arbiter fund will initially be seeded with an allocation of SNR tokens (coming from the 60% of the token supply allocated to protocol users). This will help to distribute SNR tokens to the protocol’s early adopters, rewarding positive behaviour and incentivizing involvement in arbitration.
