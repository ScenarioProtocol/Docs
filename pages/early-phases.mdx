# Early Partnering, User Onboarding and Alternative Scenario Pool Models

In addition to the default scenario pool processes already described, consideration has been given to other approaches and scenario pool structures which will be important at different phases of protocol maturity. Each of these phases presents challenges and opportunities, with these being addressed through additional strategies, revenue models and notification ‘products.’ 

* Bootstrapping phase
    * goal: populate the platform with a focused and highly-engaged user base
    * solutions: targeted and phased access whitelists; reputation tracking as a precursor to TGE; Scenario Genesis NFT prior to launch
    * goal: attract repeat users who populate the protocol with organic, genuine, high-quality scenario pools and confirmations
    * solutions: actively monitor early user behaviour in order to reward high-quality scenario pools and penalise dishonest behaviour, spam or sybil attacks; support and incentivize early Confirmers so that the app’s first users experience high quality notifications
* Early adoption by ecosystem projects and potential ‘partners’
    * goal: incentivize other projects to use the platform for notifications, bringing their communities to SCENARIO with them
    * solutions: dedicated ‘partner-project’ sub-pages; pre-funded pools with user-number triggers; NFT-gated pools; community and partnering fund
* Longer-term retail adoption 
    * goal: facilitate additional front-ends, each with teams who share a motivation for fast-tracking growth (and who stand to profit from this growth)
    * solution: builder bounty fund; SCENARIO SDK
    * goal: allow for free notifications to be offered in future
    * solutions: sustainable protocol revenue pool (‘growth pool’); pre-funded pools
