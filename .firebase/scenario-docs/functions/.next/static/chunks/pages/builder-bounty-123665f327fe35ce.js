This third party builder would be able to add an additional take-rate as part of their new product or service, and would be rewarded by the SCENARIO team in SNR tokens for bringing additional activity to the protocol. In this example, the Builder Bounty Fund is being used to fast-track adoption by supporting a front-end product that allows retail users to enjoy a fiat onramp and request notifications without having to engage with the self-custodying or on-chain aspects of the protocol. Such users may have no interest in the mechanisms that make the service effective, whilst still seeing great value in being able to generate novel and personalised notification requests that are quickly triggered when needed."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"IMAGE GOES HERE"}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"A JavaScript software development kit (SDK) will provide a quick and easy way for third-party developers to interact with Scenario's smart contracts.
