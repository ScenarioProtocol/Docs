  "Funding for building on top of the Scenario Protocol."

# Community Marketing & Partnering Fund

6% of the total supply of SNR (6,000,000 tokens) will be allocated to the funding of marketing and growth activities, including the incentivisation of community marketing initiatives. The founding team will also actively seek out partnering opportunities that have the potential to fast-track adoption with existing projects and their communities. The allocation of these funds will be at the discretion of the founding team, and will be put to use across the first 4 years of the protocol’s existence.

Together, the builder bounty and community marketing & partnering funds make up 13% of the total token supply. These tokens will function much like a project treasury during the protocol’s initial four years of growth. The founding team will use these liquid tokens to maximise growth by rewarding and incentivising specific builder, partner and community actions.
