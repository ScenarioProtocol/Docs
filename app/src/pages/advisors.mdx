# Advisors

The Scenario founding team will be supported by a small group of advisors. Up to ten advisors will be selected, with advisor slots identified to cover various specialisations. Advisors will collectively receive 2% (2,000,000) of the total supply of SNR tokens following the TGE. Specific token allotments will be determined according to the extent and nature of advising contributions made. All advisor tokens will be subject to a 3-year linear vesting period with a 1-year cliff.
